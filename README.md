You will need a coding environment that has Python and the pandas, matplotlib and openpyxl libraries.

1. Sign in to GitHub and go to <https://github.com/nicholsons/comp0035-tutorial-4-5> 
2. Select 'Use this template' which will create a copy of the repository in your account
3. In your IDE, create a new python project by creating a clone of the repository you just created in your account
4. Create and activate a new virtual environment (or activate an existing environment) in the project
5. Install pandas, matplotlib and openpyxl by doing one of the following in the virtual environment:

   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will install just the dependencies
   - `pip install -e .` will install the project code editable, and install the dependencies
